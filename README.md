# Netflix-GPT

Netflix-GPT is a client-side clone of Netflix built using React and Tailwind CSS. This project aims to replicate the Netflix interface, providing users with a rich browsing experience and trailer previews of movies. Additionally, it features a Chat GPT search function powered by Gemini APIs for personalized movie suggestions based on user interests. Sign-in and sign-up authentication are handled using Firebase, with Redux managing state and React Router DOM for page navigation. Note: Movies will not be playable, only trailers are available.
