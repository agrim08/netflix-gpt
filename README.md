Netflix-GPT

Netflix-GPT is a Netflix-inspired application built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project provides an interactive user interface with movie browsing, search, and suggestions based on user preferences using ChatGPT. The app integrates Firebase for authentication, Redux for state management, and React Router for seamless page navigation. It is designed as a client-side clone and displays movie trailers through TMDB (The Movie Database) API.
